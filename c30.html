            <h2>Learning as much as I can about C and Computer
Systems</h2>
        </header>
        <p>I'm embarking on a journey that interested me for a long time
        but I was always intimidated by it. I'm going to learn as much
        as I can about the C programming language and the intersection
        between hardware and software. I'm doing this to learn more
        about computers. I wanna understand computers inside out and
        challenge myself to learn about this incredible machine. It's
        not gonna be as glamorous as this might sound but I'm up for the
        challenge.</p>
        <p>At first I'm dedicating 40 days of learning and hoping to do
        it for 10 hours a day and I'm gonna be using a few books that I
        think will help immensely. These are the books:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>C How To Program by Paul Deitel &amp; Harvey Deitel</li>
        <li>Problem Solving And Program Design In C by Jeri Hanly &amp;
        Elliot Koffman</li>
        <li>Think Like A Programmer An Introduction To Creative Problem
        Solving by Anton Spraul</li>
        <li>Dive Into Systems A Gentle Introduction To Computer Systems
        by Suzanne Matthews &amp; Tia Newhall &amp; Kevin Webb</li>
        <li>Computer Systems A Programmer's Perspective by Bryant Randal
        &amp; O'Hallaron David</li>
        <li>A Common Sense Guide To Data Structures And Algorithms by
        Jay Wengrow</li>
        <li>Hands On Network Programming With C by Lewis Van Winkle</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The first two books for learning C and writing good programs
        with it. The third for improving my problem solving intuition.
        The fourth and fifth for learning about computer systems. The
        sixth for learning algorithms and data structures at a high
        level, and the seventh one for learning about network
        programming. All these books use C or a C flavored C++ which is
        great.</p>
        <h3 id="day-3">Day 3:</h3>
        <p>In the 7 hours I studied today I managed to learn about (I
        used Problem Solving And Program Design In C):</p>
        <ul>
        <li>functions being like building blocks for making a large
        program and how they help you solve problems by dividing each
        problem into multiple subproblems represented by a
        function.</li>
        <li>what makes a function (function definition, parameters,
        return values, function calls, arguments).</li>
        <li>some rudimentary computer graphics idease.</li>
        <li>selection statements (if, if…else, nested ifs) and
        relational and equality operators.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="day-2">Day 2:</h3>
        <p>In the 7 hours I studied today I managed to learn about (I
        used Problem Solving And Program Design In C):</p>
        <ul>
        <li>recursion at the basic level with two examples: factorial
        and fibonacci series (I used C How To Program).</li>
        <li>how to solve problems using the "software development
        method".</li>
        <li>the structure of a C program and all the C constructs that
        go into it like preprocessor directives, variable declarations,
        and the exectuable statements (instructions).</li>
        <li>data types and the various operators used to work with
        data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The book Problem Solving And Program Design In C makes a
        clear distinction between data and instructions preformed on
        that data.</p>
        <h3 id="day-1">Day 1:</h3>
        <p>In the 9 hours I studied today I managed to learn about (I
        used C How To Program):</p>
        <ul>
        <li>selection statemens (if - if…else - switch) and iteration
        statements (while - do…while - for).</li>
        <li>all the important operators and how they are used and when
        to use them.</li>
        <li>functions from the definition to the prototype to the
        function-call stack.</li>
        <li>storage classes and scope rules.</li>
        </ul>
