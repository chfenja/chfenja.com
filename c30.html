I started learning Python a while ago, and I kept thinking about what happens in memory and the cpu whenever I write something. I'm someone that loves to know what's going on behind the curtains and dig deep.
</p>

<p>
What I realised after programming with Python for a while is that it doesn't matter that much what programming language you use, what really matters is solving problems and when you git gud at solving problems then you can think more about the right language to use for the job.
</p>

<p>
With that said I think that learning a low level language like C forces you to build a mental model of what the computer is actually doing when you run a program and that's a valuable thing to have when first learning to program as it will make it easier to go one level up the layer of abstraction<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> that more high languages offer.
</p>

<p>
I'm using the book <a href="http://knking.com/books/c2/">"C Programming: A Modern Approach by K. N. King"</a>. It's a really good book, easy to read with clear explanations. The book has a lot of exercises and a ton of small programming projects after each chapter. I'll do my best to finish all of the programming projects.
</p>

<p>
For more problems I might use this book <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers/">"Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills by Brian P. Hogan"</a>

<h3 id="org09c34c8">Day 1:</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org09c34c8">
<p>
The first day was mostly about learning C syntax. The book starts with the general form of a simple C program and then talks about variables, how to format input and output with <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>, then explains all the basic operators and how to use them to form an expression and I finished with if statements and switch statements and a lot more. I covered the first 5 chapters. I did almost all the exercises but none of the programming projects yet. I'm planning on finishing the first 10 chapters and then I'll start with the programming projects for all the chapters.
