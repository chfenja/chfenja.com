<h1 class="title">Learning as much as I can about C and Computer Systems</h1>
</header><p>
I'm embarking on a journey that interested me for a long time but I was always intimidated by it. I'm going to learn as much as I can about the C programming language and the intersection between hardware and software. I'm doing this to learn more about computers. I wanna understand computers inside out and challenge myself to learn about this incredible machine. It's not gonna be as glamorous as this might sound but I'm up for the challenge.
</p>

<p>
At first I'm dedicating 40 days of learning and hoping to do it for 10 hours a day and I'm gonna be using a few books that I think will help immensely.
These are the books:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>C How To Program by Paul Deitel &amp; Harvey Deitel</li>
<li>Problem Solving And Program Design In C by Jeri Hanly &amp; Elliot Koffman</li>
<li>Think Like A Programmer An Introduction To Creative Problem Solving by Anton Spraul</li>
<li>Dive Into Systems A Gentle Introduction To Computer Systems by Suzanne Matthews &amp; Tia Newhall &amp; Kevin Webb</li>
<li>Computer Systems A Programmer's Perspective by Bryant Randal &amp; O'Hallaron David</li>
<li>A Common Sense Guide To Data Structures And Algorithms by Jay Wengrow</li>
<li>Hands On Network Programming With C by Lewis Van Winkle</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first two books for learning C and writing good programs with it. The third for improving my problem solving intuition. The fourth and fifth for learning about computer systems. The sixth for learning algorithms and data structures at a high level, and the seventh one for learning about network programming. All these books use C or a C flavored C++ which is great.

In all honesty I didn't do much today either. Maybe I worked for 1 hour but it was mostly refreshing my memory and finishing the chapter I was stuck on for the past 5 days. Tomorrow I'm going all in, I won't stop, whatever it takes to finish these books and get good at C and computer systems.

In the 7 hours I studied today I managed to learn about (I used Problem Solving And Program Design In C):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>functions being like building blocks for making a large program and how they help you solve problems by dividing each problem into multiple subproblems represented by a function.</li>
<li>what makes a function (function definition, parameters, return values, function calls, arguments).</li>
<li>some rudimentary computer graphics ideas.</li>
<li>selection statements (if, if&#x2026;else, nested ifs) and relational and equality operators.</li>
</ul>
</div>

In the 7 hours I studied today I managed to learn about (I used Problem Solving And Program Design In C):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>recursion at the basic level with two examples: factorial and fibonacci series (I used C How To Program).</li>
<li>how to solve problems using the "software development method".</li>
<li>the structure of a C program and all the C constructs that go into it like preprocessor directives, variable declarations, and the exectuable statements (instructions).</li>
<li>data types and the various operators used to work with data.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The book Problem Solving And Program Design In C makes a clear distinction between data and instructions preformed on that data.
