I'm learning C from the book "C Programming A Modern Approach" by K.N.King.

I finished chapter 3 and 4 and started a little bit of chapter 5. It was mostly about how to use <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>, what constitute an expression in C from operators to variables to constants. Learned about implementation-defined behavior and undefined behavior which is very tricky. I did all the exercises and the 12 programming projects in both chapters. I studied for 4 focused hours total.

<p>
Some interesting stuff I learned: what's an lvalue and that the assignment operator has side effects it's not just assigning a value to a variable the whole expression has a value after, which is the value assigned to the variable. To me lvalues are whatever is not a constant or a result of a computation, a name like a variable, for now at least it could be something else.

I finished chapter 2 which went over the basics of writing a simple C program (preprocessor directives: <code>#include</code> - <code>#define</code>, <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>, statements, comments, using variables, types: <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>). I did all 8 programming projects as well as all the exercises I managed to get about 3 hours of focused work.

<p>
An interesting note is that you need to append an <code>f</code> to the end of floating point constants if you want the compiler to treat it as a single precision float because by default all floating point numbers are treated as <code>double</code> when assigned to a variable.
</p>

<p>
To get warnings when compiling C programs with <code>gcc</code> use these options: -Wextra, -O, -Wall, -pedantic.
